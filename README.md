### http proxy for Luvit coro-http
Makes http CONNECT tunnelling

### Deps:
[coro-http](https://github.com/luvit/lit/blob/master/deps/coro-http.lua)  
[base64](https://github.com/luvit/lit/blob/master/deps/base64.lua) if you want to encode authorization payload

### todo:
ssl  
socks maybe?

### Ps:
I tested it only with a private proxy with authentication, create an issue if it wont work with a proxy without authentication for some reason
